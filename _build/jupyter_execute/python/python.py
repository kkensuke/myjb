# 
# [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a simple and most popular programming language and used in many fields like AI and machine learning, Data analytics, Data visualization, Web, Game, and so on.
# 
# [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a next-generation web-based user interface for python programming.
# 
# Here, you can learn basics of python and usage of JupyterLab. If you have not installed jupyteer-lab, refer to [this](../basic/packageManager.md#Venv).

# ## print() function
# 
# `print()` function is the most basic function in python. It is used to print the value of any variable or expression.
# Here, we will see how to use `print()` function with the usage of jupyter lab(notebook).

# To begin with, let us print string "Hello World" using `print()` function. 
# In jupyter lab(notebook), a code block is called a cell. A cell can contain multiple lines of code.
# To execute the code, click on the cell(colored in blue(notebook:green)) and press `Shift+Enter` key.

# In[2]:


print("Hello, world!")


# ### comment

# When programming, we often put some comments to explain the code. In python, we can use `#` to write  comments.
# 
# If you want to comment out multiple lines, you can use `""" """` to write comments (actually, this is called docstrings).

# In[1]:


# This is a comment. No output.

"""
    This
    is
    a 
    multiline
    comment.
"""


# ### Arithmetic operations

# In[1]:


print(1+1)


# In programming, every object has a data type. For example, the number `1` has the data type `int`.
# The "Hello World" string has the data type `str`. If the data types are different, the operations will be performed differently.
# 
# For example, `+` operator is used to add two numbers, and `+` operator is used to concatenate two strings.

# In[4]:


# you cannot use strings to do math.
print(3+4)
print('3+4')
print('3'+'4')


# In[5]:


# This will be an error. You can't add a number and a string. 
# You need to convert the string to a number or vice versa.
print(3+'4')


# In[3]:


a = 3 # This is a variable. 
b = '4'
print(a+b) # This will be the same as the above cell.


# In[4]:


# print out several inputs with `,`
print(a, b)


# In[7]:


print(a + int(b)) # This will convert the string to a number.
print(str(a) + b) # This will convert the number to a string.


# In[8]:


# Basic arithmetic operations
print('addition 1+1 = ', 1+1)
print('subtraction 5-1 = ', 5-1)
print('multiplication 2*2 = ', 2*2)
print('division 5/2 = ', 5/2)
print('modulus 5%2 = ', 5%2)
print('floor division 5//2 = ', 5//2)
print('exponentiation 5**2 = ', 5**2)


# In[9]:


# Instead of using a new line, you can use a semicolon.
print('adsf'); print('asdf')


# ### jupyter lab usage

# Basically, code cells are used to write code. However, we can also use code cells to write comments in markdown format.
# If you want to write in markdown format, right click around the cell and press `m`, then `Shift+Enter`. You go back to code format by pressing `y`.
# Moreover, you can add a new cell by pressing `a` or `b`(`a` is for above, `b` is for below). 
# Others; `x`; cut a cell. `c`; copy a cell. `v`; paste a cell. `z`; undo. 
#

# ## Collections(list, tuple, set, dictionary)
# 
# List, tuple, set, dictionary are used to store data in different ways.

# In[10]:


l = [3,4,5]
index = 0 # index starts with 0
print(l[index])

l[1] = 7 # You can change the value of an element in a list.
print(l)


# In[11]:


# You can use other types of data in a list.
l = [3,4,5,'a','b','c', True, False, [1,2,3]]


# In[1]:


t = (3,4,5)

t[2] = 7
# You can't change the value of an element in a tuple.
# However, a tuple uses less memory than a list.


# In[13]:


s = {3,4,5,5}
print(s)


# In[14]:


d = {'a':3,'b':4,'c':5}
print(d['a'])

d['a'] = 6 # You can change the value of an element in a dictionary.
d['d'] = 7 # You can add a new key-value pair to a dictionary.
print(d)

print(d.items()) # This will return a list of all the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
print(d.keys()) # This will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
print(d.values()) # This will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

# ## Open a file

# In[15]:


path = './sample.txt'
with open(path) as f:
    l = f.readlines()
    print(l)
    for i in range(len(l)):
        print(l[i])


# ---
# ## For loops
# 
# `for loop` is used to iterate over a collection of items.

# In[16]:


for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Index starts at 0.


# In[17]:


for i in range(5,10):
    print(i)
# Index starts at 5.
# cf. range(5,13,2)


# In[18]:


items = ['a','b','c','d','e']
for i in items:
    print(i)
# You can use a for loop to iterate over a list, tuple, dictionary, string, and so on.

print('-------------------------------')
for i in range(len(items)):
    print(items[i])


# In[19]:


for i, item in enumerate(items):
    print(i, item)


# In[20]:


for _ in range(5):
    print('Hello')


# ---
# ## Comprehension

# In[21]:


[i for i in range(5)]


# In[22]:


data = [3,14,23,28,35,46,55,65,76,87,98,109,120,131,142]
[x*10 for x in data]


# In[23]:


[x for x in data if x%2==0]


# In[24]:


[x if x>50 else x*10 for x in data]


# In[25]:


import numpy as np # This is a module. NumPy is a package that contains many useful functions for working with arrays.
a = np.arange(1,51)
fizz_buzz = ['fizzbuzz' if x%3==0 and x%5==0 else 'fizz' if x%3==0 else 'buzz' if x%5==0 else x for x in a]
print(fizz_buzz)

# ## Functions
# 
# `function` is a block of code which take inputs and returns outputs. It only runs when it is called. 
# Actually, most code we write consists of functions.

# In[26]:


def print_hello():
    print('Hello, world!')


# In[27]:


print_hello()


# In[28]:


def myfunc(arg1, arg2):
    for i in range(arg1):
        print(arg2)

myfunc(3, 'Hello')
# = myfunc(arg1=3, arg2='Hello')


# In[29]:


import numpy as np # NumPy is a package that contains many useful functions for working with arrays.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Matplotlib is a package that contains many useful functions for plotting.

x = np.linspace(0,10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

print(x[:5])
print(y[:5])


# In[30]:


plt.plot(x,y)
plt.title('sin')
plt.show()


# ### lambda functions

# $$ f(x) = x^2 $$

# In[32]:


f = lambda x: x**2

print(f(3))
